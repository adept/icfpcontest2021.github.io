<h1>Writeups</h1>

  <p>
    The 2021 ICFP contest ran from 9 July 2021 to 12 July 2021.  Since then,
    a number of teams have published very interesting writeups about the
    approaches they used.  We tried to link them here.
    If you would like to add something to this list, please
    <a href="https://github.com/icfpcontest2021/icfpcontest2021.github.io/edit/main/writeups.html">edit this file on GitHub</a>
    and send us a PR.
